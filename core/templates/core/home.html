                    <p>
                        From developing Java-based Minecraft mods at age 10 to launching an online store with cryptocurrency payments at 11, I've always thrived on creating solutions through code. Today, as a Mechatronics Engineering student specializing in Applied Machine Learning, I channel that same passion into real-world projects that span machine learning, simulations, and AI.

I’m driven by the challenge of transforming complex problems into impactful solutions, and I continually seek out new technologies to enhance my skill set. My goal? To make a lasting impact through innovative, efficient, and meaningful engineering solutions. Let’s connect and see how I can bring this dedication to your team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With experience in both technical and leadership roles, I enjoy collaborating with teams to bring ideas to life. I have led initiatives in education, teaching martial arts to students, which has sharpened my communication and mentoring skills. I am always eager to embrace new challenges and learn from them, aiming to contribute meaningfully to projects that make a positive impact in the world.
